Telegram Bot APi access written in Rust

The goal of this Bot API is to stick as close as possible to the official Telegram Bot API (https://core.telegram.org/bots/api),
since other crates are pretty limited in their functions.

This project is WIP, but feel free to try it out and to report possible issues.
